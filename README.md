1. Majority Card Finder with Divide and Conquer
This program identifies a majority card (one whose first character matches more than half of the total cards) using a divide-and-conquer approach and dynamic programming. It divides the set into subsets, finds potential majorities in each, and combines the results to determine if a majority card exists. It is efficient and suited for large datasets.

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Animations in Manim
This program implements the BFS algorithm on graphs with Manim animations. It visually demonstrates level-by-level exploration, highlighting visited nodes and the queue structure used. It's ideal for teaching how BFS traverses a graph, showing the visitation order and node connections clearly.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS) with Animations in Manim
This program implements the DFS algorithm with Manim animations, showcasing how it explores deep paths in a graph before backtracking. It emphasizes the use of a stack and animates the process of visiting and backtracking nodes. Perfect for understanding DFSâ€™s recursive logic and comparing its behavior to BFS.
